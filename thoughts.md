I am all about principles and laws and self imposed restrictions. I find that they help me focus on writing good software. I will hypothosize that the reason this turns out to be true, at least for me, is that these are simply patterns to deal with and minimize complexity.

As you practice TDD, you get good at it. You can effectively "call" every "shot" as you progress, essentially, always thinking a move ahead of your code execution.

As you practise refactoring, the same thing happens. You get good at it, and it becomes almost muscle memory. You can see the patterns to eliminate and the patterns that replace them with ease.

When you get to that point, you realize that 'skill' is exactly what it was when you wasted your life on video games. You died. And died. And died. And started over, and tried new things, and died and died and died.

Eventually, you trained your brain and your muscles to detect patterns in the game, and you used patterns to effectively counter the enemy AI and exploit the shit out of it.

Do the same for your code.
